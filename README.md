# Rock_Paper_Scissors

This is a project where I will create a popular game called Rock Papers and Scissors and during the creation of this game I will be revising my learnings and put them to test such as functions, methods, conditional statements, data types and variables.

## Learnings

After completion of this project I learned if you put a method like toLowerCase() in your conditional statements you have to convert the value you are comparing to lowercase else it will cause a logical error and I also learned to provide a backup value if the prompt is cancelled such as in my case I provided Rock:). Additionally I learned about case sensitivity and how much it matters in javascript along with the usage of loops to repeat the code and learned a little bit about arrays to.
